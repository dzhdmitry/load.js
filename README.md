**load.js is a micro JS lazy-loader**

Built on top of [chain.js](https://github.com/chriso/chain.js), it allows you to lazy load your JS scripts sequentially or in parallel and handle complex dependency chains.

### Example

```javascript
load('jquery.js').then('jquery-ui.js', 'jquery-ui-theme.js').then('myscript.js').thenRun(function () {
    alert('Loaded.');
});

load('underscore.js');
```

**Some things to note:**

- `then()` is an alias for the previous method in the chain
- once *jQuery* has loaded, *jquery-ui.js* and *jquery-ui-theme.js* are loaded in parallel. When both are complete, *myscript.js* is loaded
- each chain is separate, so *underscore* and *jQuery* will load in parallel

### Example 2

Load a script after a 0.5s delay

```javascript
defer(500).thenLoad('myscript2.js');
```

### Example 3

```javascript
load('myscript2.js').onError(function (err) {
    //Handle any errors here..
});
```

### Example 4

Load script with custom attributes

```javascript
load({src: 'jquery.js'}) // similar to load('jquery.js')

load({
    'src': 'dropbox.js',
    'api-key' : 'API_KEY'
})
// will load <script src="dropbox.js" api-key="API_KEY" ...
```
